- 👋 Hi, I’m @VixenBQ
- 👀 I will not hide - I want to learn effective and necessary knowledge so that I can earn enough to travel and live in other countries. I study IT not because I like it, but as an opportunity to change my life.
- 🌱 Now I am learning python as one of the simplest and most effective programming languages
- 💞️ I will gladly accept any help, advice, constructive criticism, from any person.
- 📫 I can answer you by mail: vitaliiotverchenko@gmail.com
